        "\n",
        "Next, we have an import from `google.colab`, which suggests this code might be running in Google Colab - a cloud-based environment for data science and machine learning development. The specific import, `userdata`, isn't being used directly here but could potentially provide access to user-specific information or settings within the Colab environment.\n",

        "Additionally, we're importing functions from PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module - specifically, the `softmax` function. This function is commonly used in machine learning models to normalize output values, making it easier to interpret them as probabilities.\n",

        "Lastly, two key imports come from the `transformers` library: `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` and `AutoTokenizer`. The transformers library provides a wide range of pre-trained models for various NLP tasks. `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` is used for tasks where you're trying to classify text into different categories (e.g., sentiment analysis), while `AutoTokenizer` helps prepare the input text data for these models by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces called tokens. These imports suggest that this code will be working with pre-trained NLP models and preparing text data for classification tasks."
