First, the tokenizer breaks down our text \"It was a dark and stormy\" into tokens - think of these as the basic units of meaning that the model understands. Then, it converts each token into a unique number (an ID) that represents that token in the model's vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `.input_ids` part extracts just the sequence of numbers we need - this is what gets fed into the model. If you were to print out input_ids, you'd see a list of integers. Each integer corresponds to a specific token in the model's vocabulary. For example, you might see something like [1234, 567, 890, 432, 765] where 1234 might represent \"It\", 567 might represent \"was\", and so on.\n",

The model has been trained to understand and work with these numbers rather than the original text. This numbering system is consistent - \"It\" will always get the same number every time it appears, ensuring the model can reliably understand the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "What makes this particularly interesting is that the tokenization might not split the text exactly where we expect. For instance, common word combinations might be treated as single tokens, and some words might be split into multiple tokens. The model learned during its training period which combinations of characters should be grouped together for most efficient processing.\n",

        "\n",

        "The first line introduces a crucial transformation: `final_logits.softmax(dim=0)`. The softmax function converts our raw logits (which could be any numbers) into probabilities that add up to 100%. This is like converting test scores into percentages - it gives us a standardized way to compare the model's confidence in different predictions. The `dim=0` parameter tells softmax to operate along the vocabulary dimension, ensuring all word probabilities sum to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we call `torch.topk()` on these probabilities, we get both the values (probabilities) and indices (word positions), just like before. But now the values represent actual percentages rather than raw scores.\n",
        "\n",

        "- `{value.item():.2%}` converts each probability to a percentage with 2 decimal places\n",

        "This visualization reveals something fascinating about how the model thinks. The high percentage for \"night\" (if that's indeed the top prediction) would tell us that the model is very confident about this completion - it has strongly learned the pattern \"It was a dark and stormy night\" from its training data. The rapidly decreasing percentages for other words show us which alternatives the model considers plausible but less likely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding these probabilities is crucial for text generation because they help us balance between predictability and creativity. Always choosing the highest probability word would give us very conventional text, while incorporating lower probability choices (in a controlled way) can lead to more interesting and varied outputs while still maintaining coherence.\n",

        "This kind of probability analysis also helps us understand why language models sometimes make surprising choices - even a word with a seemingly low probability of 1% still has a chance of being selected if we're using probabilistic sampling methods rather than always taking the top prediction."

        "The first line, `output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens = 20)`, tells our model to continue the text. Think of it like giving a storyteller the beginning of a story and asking them to continue it. The `max_new_tokens = 20` parameter sets a limit - it's like saying \"give me about 20 more words.\" This is important because without a limit, the model could theoretically keep generating text forever!\n",
        "\n",
        "During generation, the model repeatedly uses what it has written so far to predict the next word. It's similar to how a human might write a story - after writing \"It was a dark and stormy\", we think about what word would make sense next, write it down, then use all of that (including our new word) to think about what should come after that, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second line, `decoded_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0])`, converts the model's numerical output back into readable text. The `[0]` is needed because the model's output is structured to handle multiple sequences at once (even though we only have one in this case). It's like opening an envelope containing the complete story the model has written.\n",
        "\n",
        "This generation process is particularly interesting because it can use different strategies to pick each next word. By default, it doesn't always pick the most likely word (which could make the text repetitive and boring), but instead uses some randomness to make more interesting choices while still maintaining coherence. This balance between predictability and creativity is what allows language models to generate text that feels natural and engaging.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we run these lines, we'll see our original prompt \"It was a dark and stormy\" followed by the model's continuation. The continuation might describe a dramatic scene, perhaps starting with \"night\" and going on to paint a picture of weather conditions or set up a story. Because of the probabilistic nature of text generation, running this code multiple times could give us different continuations, each one a unique take on how the story might unfold.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding this generation process helps explain both the strengths and limitations of language models. They can create remarkably coherent text by building on context one word at a time, but they need careful guidance (through parameters like max_new_tokens) to generate text that's useful for specific purposes."

        "\n",
        "The key new parameter here is `num_beams=5`. To understand beam search, imagine you're writing a story and, at each step, you keep track of the 5 most promising versions of how the story could continue. It's like having 5 different authors working in parallel, each exploring a slightly different path for the story. At each step, all 5 authors propose their next word, but only the most promising continuations survive to the next round.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break this down with an example. Starting with our prompt \"It was a dark and stormy\":\n",
        "1. The model first generates 5 possible continuations, maybe something like:\n",
        "   - \"It was a dark and stormy night in the...\"\n",
        "   - \"It was a dark and stormy evening when...\"\n",
        "   - \"It was a dark and stormy sky above...\"\n",
        "   - \"It was a dark and stormy day that...\"\n",
        "   - \"It was a dark and stormy afternoon as...\"\n",
        "\n",
        "2. For each of these 5 paths, the model then generates multiple possible next words, scoring each complete sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. From all these possibilities (which could be 25 or more different sequences), the model keeps only the 5 best ones for the next round.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process continues until we reach our `max_new_tokens=30` limit. The final output we see is the single best sequence found among all these parallel explorations.\n",
        "\n",
        "What makes beam search particularly powerful is that it looks ahead before committing to a choice. Unlike our previous generation method, which made one decision at a time and stuck with it, beam search maintains multiple possibilities and can \"change its mind\" if a different path turns out to be more promising. It's like being able to peek at how different story directions might unfold before choosing the best one.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we run this code, we typically get more coherent and well-structured text compared to simpler generation methods. That's because beam search helps avoid the \"local maxima\" problem - situations where making the most obvious choice at each step might not lead to the best overall sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there's a trade-off: while beam search often produces more polished and conventional text, it might be less creative than other methods because it tends to stick to the most probable sequences. This is why different generation strategies are useful for different purposes - beam search when we want more predictable, high-quality output, and other methods when we want more creative or diverse text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The decoded output we see is the culmination of this careful exploration process - the single best path found after considering many possible continuations at each step. This methodical approach to text generation helps explain why beam search is often used in applications where output quality and coherence are particularly important."
