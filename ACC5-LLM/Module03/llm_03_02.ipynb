Think of temperature like a creativity dial - at lower values like 0.2, the model gives very consistent, predictable responses, while higher values like 0.7 allow for more variety and creative exploration. At 0.7, the model strikes a balance between being reliable and having enough creativity to handle diverse tasks well.\n",

        "The `repetition_penalty` of 1.1 helps prevent the model from getting stuck repeating itself. When generating text, language models sometimes fall into patterns of repeating phrases or ideas. By setting this penalty slightly above 1.0, we make repeated words or phrases slightly less likely to be chosen, which leads to more natural-sounding text. Think of it like gently nudging a conversation partner to use fresh language rather than saying the same things over and over.\n",
        "\n",
        "`max_new_tokens` sets a limit of 2000 tokens for the model's responses. In language models, a token is roughly equal to 3/4 of a word - so 2000 tokens translates to approximately 1500 words. This limit acts like setting a maximum page length for an essay - it ensures responses don't run too long while still allowing enough space for thorough explanations.\n",

Environment variables act like a secure bulletin board that different parts of your program can check to find important information. Setting the API key as an environment variable makes it accessible to any OpenAI-related code that might need it later, while still keeping it more secure than if it were written directly in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, `client = OpenAI(api_key = api_key)` creates a connection point to OpenAI's services. Think of this client as a dedicated phone line - once it's set up with the right credentials (the API key), your code can use it to have secure conversations with OpenAI's systems. All future requests to OpenAI's services will go through this authenticated client.\n",
        "\n",
        "This security-focused approach follows a key principle in software development: keeping sensitive credentials separate from the main code while still making them available when needed. It's similar to how a hotel key card system works - the front desk securely stores the ability to create key cards, but guests can still use their cards to access their rooms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding this authentication setup is crucial because it forms the foundation for all subsequent interactions with OpenAI's services. Without proper authentication, none of the AI model interactions we want to perform would be possible."

        "\n",
        "The heart of the function is the `client.chat.completions.create()` call, which sends our request to OpenAI's API. Think of this like having a conversation with an AI - we're setting up both what we want to say and how we want the AI to respond.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `messages` parameter creates the context for our conversation. It includes two key parts:\n",

        "2. The user's prompt that we want the AI to respond to\n",
        "\n",
        "The generation parameters work together to shape the response:\n",
        "- `top_p` at 0.9 means the AI will only consider the most likely 90% of possible next words. This helps balance between creativity and staying on topic.\n",
        "- `max_tokens` limits the length of the response, preventing overly long outputs\n",
        "- `temperature` influences how \"creative\" versus \"focused\" the responses will be\n",
        "- `n=1` requests just one response\n",
        "- `stop=None` means the AI will continue generating until it reaches a natural stopping point or hits the max_tokens limit\n",
        "\n",
        "After getting the response, the function extracts the generated text with `response.choices[0].message.content.strip()`. The `.strip()` call removes any extra whitespace, ensuring clean output.\n",
        "\n",

        "The `evaluation_steps` parameter gets more specific. It contains a single instruction: \"Check whether the sentences in 'actual output' aligns with that in 'input'\".

        "\n",
        "This metric plays a crucial role in quality control for AI systems.

        "\n",
        "The structure of this metric reflects a fundamental principle in AI evaluation: responses need to be not just well-formed, but relevant and connected to what was asked. It's similar to how in human conversation, we naturally evaluate whether someone's response actually addresses what we said, not just whether their words make grammatical sense.\n",

        "`print(coherence_metric.reason)` displays the explanation for why the metric assigned that particular score.

        "This evaluation approach reflects a fundamental principle in AI development: we need both quantitative measures (the score) and qualitative feedback (the reason) to effectively improve our systems.

        "This code sets up and runs a specialized evaluation system to assess how well an AI model summarizes text. Let me walk you through how it works and why each component matters for measuring summary quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code begins by creating a test case with `LLMTestCase`. This test case takes two essential pieces: `muhtext` (the original text to be summarized) and `output2` (the AI's summary of that text). Think of this like giving an evaluator both the original book and a student's book report - we need both to judge how well the summary captures the source material.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the code creates a `SummarizationMetric` object. This metric is specifically designed to evaluate summaries, much like how we might have specialized rubrics for different types of writing assignments. The metric uses the same model specified in our configuration class (`CFG.model`), ensuring consistency in how we evaluate the summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `assessment_questions` parameter is particularly interesting. It sets up three key criteria that shape how we evaluate summary quality:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"Is the coverage score based on a percentage of 'yes' answers?\" - This question helps establish how the scoring system works. By using yes/no questions as building blocks, we can create a quantifiable way to measure summary quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \"Does the score ensure the summary's accuracy with the source?\" - This focuses on factual correctness. Just like a good book report shouldn't misrepresent the original text, a good AI summary needs to stay true to its source material.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \"Does a higher score mean a more comprehensive summary?\" - This establishes the relationship between scores and quality. Understanding that higher scores indicate better coverage helps us interpret the results meaningfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation process runs with `metric.measure(test_case)`, analyzing how well the summary performs against these criteria. Think of it like running a comprehensive review of a student's work against a detailed grading rubric.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code then outputs two crucial pieces of information:\n",
        "- `metric.score`: A numerical value representing the quality of the summary\n",
        "- `metric.reason`: An explanation of why the summary received that score\n",
        "\n",
        "This combination of numerical scoring and detailed reasoning is vital for understanding summary quality. The score gives us a quick way to compare different summaries, while the reason helps us understand specifically what makes a summary effective or where it might fall short. It's similar to how a writing instructor might give both a grade and detailed feedback on an essay.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding this evaluation system is crucial for anyone working with AI summarization tools. The specific assessment questions reveal what we value in a good summary: comprehensive coverage, accuracy to the source, and the ability to capture key information effectively. This structured approach to evaluation helps ensure that AI-generated summaries meet high standards of quality and usefulness.\n",
        "\n",
        "By breaking down the assessment into specific questions and providing both quantitative and qualitative feedback, this system helps us not just measure but also improve the quality of AI-generated summaries over time. This systematic approach to evaluation is essential for developing AI systems that can create increasingly reliable and effective summaries."

        "\n",
        "The code starts by creating an `AnswerRelevancyMetric`. This metric focuses specifically on how well the AI's answer aligns with both the question asked and the scientific context provided. Setting `include_reason=True` tells the metric to explain its scoring decisions, which helps us understand exactly how well the response connects to the question and context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the code creates a test case with three key components:\n",
        "- `input`: The combined prompt we created earlier that asks about photosynthesis\n",
        "- `actual_output`: The AI's response stored in the `output` variable\n",
        "- `retrieval_context`: The scientific context about photosynthesis converting light energy into chemical energy\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of this setup like creating a comprehensive grading system. The metric acts as our evaluator, examining not just whether the answer mentions photosynthesis, but how well it incorporates and builds upon the provided scientific context.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we run `metric.measure(test_case)`, the system performs a detailed analysis. This evaluation process examines how effectively the response addresses the original question while staying true to the scientific principles outlined in the context. It's similar to how a science teacher might evaluate a student's answer by checking both their understanding of the question and their use of correct scientific concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code then outputs two vital pieces of information:\n",
        "1. `metric.score`: A numerical value that quantifies how relevant and accurate the answer is\n",
        "2. `metric.reason`: A detailed explanation of why the answer received that particular score\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding these evaluation results is crucial for improving AI responses. The score gives us a quick way to gauge performance, while the reason helps us identify specific strengths or areas needing improvement in how the AI explains scientific concepts. This combination helps ensure that AI-generated explanations of complex topics like photosynthesis are both accurate and helpful for learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "This evaluation approach reflects a fundamental principle in science education: answers should be both technically accurate and clearly connected to the question being asked. By measuring both relevancy and scientific accuracy, we can ensure that AI explanations serve as effective teaching tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "The inclusion of the retrieval context is particularly important here because it provides a foundation for evaluating scientific accuracy. Just as a teacher uses textbook definitions to verify student answers, this system uses the provided context to ensure the AI's explanation aligns with established scientific understanding of photosynthesis."
