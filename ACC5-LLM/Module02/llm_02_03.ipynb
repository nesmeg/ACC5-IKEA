        "2. **Searching for max length setting**: It then searches for the maximum sequence length setting within the model's configuration.

        "\n",
        "3. **Checking each possible setting**: For each of these potential settings, it attempts to retrieve the value using `getattr`. If a value is found (i.e., not `None`), it prints a message indicating that it has found the maximum length and breaks out of the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Defaulting to a standard max length**: If none of the expected settings are found in the model's configuration, it defaults to a maximum sequence length of 1024. This is a common default value for many models, especially those based on transformer architectures like BERT or RoBERTa.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Returning the max length**: Finally, the function returns the determined maximum sequence length, whether it was found in the model's configuration or defaulted to 1024."

        "Here's what's happening:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The code selects a specific example from the test dataset, identified by the `index` variable (set to 10 in this case). It retrieves the conversation text (`prompt`) and the corresponding human-written summary (`summary`) for that example.\n",
        "2. The conversation text is then formatted into a prompt that can be fed into the language model. The prompt includes an instruction to summarize the conversation, followed by the conversation text itself, and finally an \"Output:\" label to indicate where the model's response should start.\n",
        "3. The `gen` function (not shown in this code snippet) is called with the formatted prompt, the language model (`original_model`), and a maximum output length of 100 tokens. This generates a response from the model, which is stored in the `res` variable.\n",
        "4. The model's response is then processed to extract the actual generated text, by splitting the response at the \"Output:\\n\" label and taking the second part (i.e., everything after the label). This extracted text is stored in the `output` variable.\n",
        "5. The code stores the generated output in a dictionary called `zeroshot_responses`, with a key that includes the index of the example being processed (e.g., \"f10\").\n",
        "6. Finally, the code prints out several things:\n",
        "\t* A dashed line (`dash_line`) to separate the different sections of output.\n",
        "\t* The input prompt that was fed into the model.\n",
        "\t* The human-written baseline summary for comparison.\n",
        "\t* The model's generated summary (i.e., the `output` variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this code is to evaluate the performance of the language model in generating summaries of conversations, by comparing its output to human-written summaries. The `%time` magic command at the beginning of the code block suggests that the execution time of this code may also be measured and reported."

        "\t* `lora_alpha=32`: This is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the adaptation.\n",
        "\t* `target_modules`: This specifies the modules within the model that should be adapted using LORA. In this case, it includes the query, key, and value projection layers (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`) as well as the dense layer (`dense`).\n",
        "\t* `bias=\"none\"`: This indicates that the bias terms of the model's weights should not be adapted.\n",
        "\t* `lora_dropout=0.05`: This is a dropout rate applied to the LORA adaptation process.\n",
        "\t* `task_type=\"CAUSAL_LM\"`: This specifies the type of task being performed, which in this case is causal language modeling.\n",
        "2. The code enables gradient checkpointing for the original model using the `gradient_checkpointing_enable()` method. This technique stores only the gradients of the model's weights at certain checkpoints during backpropagation, rather than storing the entire computation graph. This can significantly reduce memory usage during fine-tuning.\n",
        "3. The `prepare_model_for_kbit_training` function from the PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) library is applied to the original model. This prepares the model for efficient fine-tuning by modifying its architecture and adding necessary components, such as LORA adapters.\n",
        "4. The `get_peft_model` function is used to create a new model that incorporates the LORA adaptation method. This model is then moved to the specified device (e.g., GPU) using the `to()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting `peft_model` is now ready for fine-tuning using the LORA method, which can adapt the model's weights in a efficient and effective way while minimizing the number of additional parameters required."
