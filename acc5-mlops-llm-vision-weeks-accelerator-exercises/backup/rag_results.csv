            For a classic look with a timeless feel, I highly recommend the TÄNNFORSEN / RUTSJÖN bathroom vanity with sink & faucet. This product is available in two elegant colors: gray ($584.0) and white ($624.0). The gray version features a light gray finish with beveled panels that add a sense of craftsmanship and attention to detail, while the white version boasts a classic look in white with beautiful details such as beveled panels. Both options will give your bathroom a warm and graceful ambiance that becomes a statement of your unique style.

            This product offers generous full drawer storage capacity for all your essentials, with piping led through the back and not via a cut-out in the drawers. The drawers open all the way for a good overview, and you can add knobs or handles to create the spot-on solution for your style and taste (sold separately). The ceramic wash-basin has a soft shape and durable surface, made with the best materials to outlast many years of wear and tear.

            Key measurements and dimensions for the TÄNNFORSEN / RUTSJÖN are not explicitly stated, but the product is designed to be wall-mounted, creating a spacious feel and making it easier to clean floors underneath. You can also add legs depending on the look you prefer. This cabinet is part of the TÄNNFORSEN series, allowing you to combine it with other cabinets to create a coordinated bathroom solution that fits your space and needs.

            Installation requirements for this product include wall-mounting, which is a relatively straightforward process. You will need to cut holes for the wash-basin and mixer tap on your own, as the countertop is available as pre-cut.

            Compatibility with other items is not a concern, as the TÄNNFORSEN series is designed to work together seamlessly.
