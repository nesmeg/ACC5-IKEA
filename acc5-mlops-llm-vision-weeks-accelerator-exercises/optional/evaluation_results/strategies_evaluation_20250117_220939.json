      "model_response": " For a small bathroom, I recommend the ENHET washstand with storage. You have three options to choose from: Item No. 99547652 ($484.99), Item No. 29546953 ($543.99), and Item No. 69547074 ($431.99). All three products offer a shallow design that can fit perfectly in small bathrooms, providing ample storage space for your essentials.\n\n        The ENHET washstand has a compact footprint of 31 x 15 inches (79 x 38 cm) and stands at a height of 29 inches (74 cm). It features two open shelves for storing toiletries and towels, as well as two closed cabinets for keeping personal items out of sight.\n\n        Considering the prices, I would recommend starting with the most affordable option, Item No. 69547074 ($431.99). This product offers excellent value for its price, providing you with the same functionality as the other two options but at a lower cost.\n\n        If you're willing to invest a bit more, Item No. 99547652 ($484.99) is another great choice. This product has a slightly larger footprint than the other two options, measuring 35 x 15 inches (89 x 38 cm), but it also offers additional storage space in the form of a built-in towel rack.\n\n        Finally, if you're looking for the largest capacity and don't mind spending a bit more, Item No. 29546953 ($543.99) is the way to go. This product has an even larger footprint of 39 x 15 inches (100 x 38 cm) and includes an additional shelf for storing larger items like baskets or bins.\n\n        All three products come with a beautiful mirror that provides ample reflection space, making it easier to get ready in the morning.\n\n        End of recommendations",
